## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
seq(1,20)
```

## Question 1 

The Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic." The dataset is available from the Department of Biostatistics at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv)in several formats. store the Titanic Data Set `titanic_train` using the following commands. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
titanic_train <- read.csv("titanic3.csv", header=TRUE)
```

a) Extract the columns `sex`, `age`, `cabin` and `survived` into a new data frame of the name 'titanicSubset'.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
titanicSubset = subset(titanic_train, select = c(sex, age, cabin, survived))
```


b) Use the aggregate() function to display the total number of survivors grouped by `sex`

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
aggregate(titanicSubset$survived, by = list(Sex = titanicSubset$sex), FUN = sum)
```

c) Use the count() function in `dplyr` package to display the total number of passengers within each Ticket Class `pclass`.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
titanic_train %>% count(pclass)
```

d) Answer the following graphically (using visualization):
1. What are the survival rates for females and males?
2. What is the age distribution on the Titanic?

Hint: You can use ggplot2
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
g<- ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x=sex, y=survived, color = sex))
g + geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) 
g2<- ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x=age, y=seq(1, length(age))))
g2 + geom_point()

```

e)Use the `for` loop and `if` control statements to list the women's names, age 34 or more that embarked from S (Southampton), on the Titanic.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
for (row in 1:nrow(titanic_train)) {
  if ((titanic_train[row, 'age'] >= 34) & (titanic_train[row, 'embarked'] == 'S') & (titanic_train[row, 'sex'] == 'female') & (!is.na(titanic_train[row, 'age']))) 
    {print(titanic_train[row, 'name'], max.levels = 0)
  } 
} 


```

## Question 2

A study was conducted on GRE test takers to evaluate the success conditions. The success rate is 25%. A sample of 30 test takers is selected for the study. Use the binomial distribution to calculate the followings:

a) The probability that 10 test takers fail the GRE test:
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
dbinom(10, size = 30, prob = 0.25)

```

b) The probability of getting at least five test takers succeed in the test
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
1 - pbinom(q = 4, size = 30, prob = 0.25)
```

c) The probability of 25 or less fail the test
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pbinom(q = 25, size = 30, prob = 0.75)
```

## Question 3 

In a shipment of 100 tiles in a box, history shows that the probability of one tile in a box is defective is 0.2

a) Use the Binomial approximation to calculate the probability that more than 20 tiles are defective? 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
1 - pbinom(20, size = 100, prob = 0.2)
```

b) Use the Poisson approximation to calculate the probability that at most 20 tiles are defective? 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
ppois(20, lambda = 20)
```

c) Use the binomial approximation to calculate the probability that at most 20 tiles are defective? 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pbinom(20, size = 100, prob = 0.2)
```

d) Compare the results of parts b and c, then illustrate graphically (compare visually) on how well the Poisson probability distribution approximates the Binomial probability distribution.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
success <- 0:60
plot(success, ppois(success, lambda = 20),type = 'h', main = 'Poisson Probability Distribution')
plot(success, pbinom(success, size = 100, prob = 0.2), type = 'h', main = 'Binomial Probability Distribution')

```

## Question 4 

Write a script in R to compute the following probabilities of a normal random variable with mean 16 and variance 9

a) lies between 14.4 and 20.3 (inclusive)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pnorm(20.3, 16, sd=3)-pnorm(14.4, 16, sd=3)
```


b) is greater than 21.8
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pnorm(21.8, 16, sd=3, lower.tail = FALSE)
```


c) is less than or equal to 10.5
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pnorm(10.5, 16, sd=3, lower.tail = TRUE)
```


d) is less than 13 or greater than 19
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
pnorm(19, 16, sd=3, lower.tail = TRUE)-pnorm(13, 16, sd=3, lower.tail = TRUE)
```
