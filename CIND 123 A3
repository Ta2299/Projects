## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.


## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(2,4,6,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
seq(2,20,by = 2)
```
### Note:

You will use 'Admission_Predict.csv' for Assignment-3. This dataset includes the data of the applicants of an academic program. Each application has a unique serial number, which represents a particular student. The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included are :

1) GRE Scores (out of 340)

2) TOEFL Scores (out of 120)

3) University Rating (out of 5)

4) Statement of Purpose (SOP) (out of 5)

5) Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength (out of 5)

6) Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)

7) Research Experience (either 0 or 1)

8) Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)


**Download "Admission_Predict.csv" dataset and load it as 'data'.**
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
data <- read.csv("Admission_Predict.csv")
```


## Question 1 (30 points in total)


a)

  i- Display the first three rows in this dataset.(1 point)
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
head(data, 3)
```


  ii - Display the structure of all variables.(1 point)
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
str(data)
```
  

  iii - Print the descriptive statistics of the admission data to understand the    data a little better (min, max, mean, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles). (1 point)
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
summary(data)
```
  

  iv - Use a histogram to assess the normality of the 'Chance.of.Admit' variable    and explain whether it appears normally distributed or not and why? (1 point)

```{r}

#Insert your code here.
hist(data$Chance.of.Admit, xlab = 'Chance of Admit', main = 'Histogram of Chance of Admit')
#it does not appear to be normally distributed as the histogram shows it is skewed to the left 
```

b)   Create a set of boxplots that shows the distribution of Chance.of.Admit on SOP variables. Use different colors for different SOP score marks. Hint: SOP scores are changing between 1,1.5, to 5, therefore you can use different box colours for each score likewise; 1 (red), 1.5(green), etc. (8 points)
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
colours = c('firebrick1','darkorange','goldenrod1','darkolivegreen1','cadetblue1','deepskyblue2','mediumpurple1', 'mediumorchid1', 'palevioletred1')
boxplot(data$Chance.of.Admit ~ data$SOP, ylab = 'Chance of Admit', xlab = 'SOP', col=colours, main = 'Distribution of Chance of Admit on SOP')
``` 

c) 

i- Find the covariance between the "GRE.Score" and the "Chance.of.Admit". (3 points)

```{r}

#Insert your code here.
cov(data$GRE.Score, data$Chance.of.Admit)
```

ii- Print or plot the correlation matrix of the data and write down the correlations between the GRE.Score, TOEFL.Score, CGPA and the Chance.of.Admit. (3 points)

```{r}

#Insert your code here.
matrix1 <- cor(data[c('GRE.Score','TOEFL.Score','CGPA', 'Chance.of.Admit')])
matrix1
#install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)
corrplot(matrix1, method = 'number')
```

iii - Interpret the covariance and correlation results obtained from c(i) and c(ii) in terms of the strength and direction of the relationship. (4 points)
```{r}
#Insert your code here.
#The CGPA has the highest positive correlation with the chance of admission followed by the GRE Score and then the TOEFL score
#The co-variance also tells us that the GRE.Score is strongly correlated with the chance of admission
```

d)  Use ggplot() to plot the graphs to see the relationship between each of three variables (GRE.Score, TOEFL.Score, CGPA) with Chance.of.Admit. (8 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=GRE.Score, y=Chance.of.Admit)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=TOEFL.Score, y=Chance.of.Admit)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=CGPA, y=Chance.of.Admit)) + geom_point()
```

## Question 2 (40 points in total)


a) 

i- Define the linear regression model  between  GRE.Score and Chance.of.Admit (3 points)


```{r}
#Insert your code here.
model2 <- lm(Chance.of.Admit ~ GRE.Score, data = data)
model2
```

ii - Plot the regression (least-square) line on the same plot.(3 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
plot(Chance.of.Admit ~ GRE.Score, data = data)
abline(model2)
```


ii- -  Explain the meaning of the slope and y-intercept for the least-squares regression line in Q2(ii). (3 points)

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
#The meaning of the slope is that the higher your GRE Score, the chance of being admitted positively increases. The y-intercept shows a GRE score of 0 would have a chance of admission of less than 0. Also a GRE score of 290 would have a chance of admission of 0.3

```
b) Print the results of this model and interpret the results by following questions:

i -  What is the number of observations was the regression run on? (3 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
summary(model2)
nobs(model2)
#400 observations
```

ii -  Interpret the R-squared of this regression? (4 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
#The R squared for this regression is 0.6442
```

iii -  Write the regression equation associated with this regression model? (4 points)
```{r}
#regression equation: -2.4360842 + 0.0099759 * GRE.Score
 
```

c) Use the regression line to predict the chance of admit when GRE score 310. (10 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
predict(model2, newdata = data.frame(GRE.Score = 310))

```

d) From the given Q2(a) linear model between GRE.Score and Chance.of.Admit, what should be GRE score of a student who has 50% of chance of admission?(10 points)

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
#-2.4360842 + 0.0099759 * GRE.Score = 0.50
#GRE.Score = (0.50 + 2.4360842)/0.0099759 
          (0.50 + 2.4360842)/0.0099759 
# GRE.Score = 294.3177 for a student who has a 50% chance of admission

```

## Question 3 (30 points in total)

a) Use three independent variables ('GRE.Score','TOEFL.Score', 'CGPA')  to build a multiple linear regression model to predict dependent variable 'Chance.of.Admit'. Display a summary of your model indicating Residuals, Coefficients, etc. Explain the summary results. (8 points)

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
model3 <- lm(Chance.of.Admit ~ GRE.Score + TOEFL.Score + CGPA, data = data)
summary(model3)
#The results indicate the highest significance is the two variables GRE.Score and CGPA although all variables are significant. According to the R-Squared values, the model seems pretty good. The model is also significant because the p-value is less than 0.05.
```

b) Write the regression equation associated with this multiple regression model. (8 points)

```{r}

#Insert your code here.
#Chance.of.Admit = -1.5856984 + 0.0022660 * GRE.Score + 0.0031123 * TOEFL.Score + 0.1462844 * CGPA
```

c) Using this model:

i- Find the chance of admit for the 3rd student and 23rd students in the dataset. (4 points)

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
predict(model3)[c(3, 23)]
```

ii- Identify which student (3rd or 23rd) has higher chance than the other and print the difference between the chance of admit of these two students.(3 points)

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
#The 23rd student has a higher chance because their chance of admission is higher with 90.83% compared to student 3 who has a chance of 62.43%
predict(model3)[23] - predict(model3)[3]
```

d) Explain the difference between the linear regression models in Question 2 and in Question 3. (7 points)
```{r}

#Insert your code here.
#The model in Q2 differs from the model in Q3 because the Q2 model compares the chance of admission against one variable to form a prediction whereas the Q3 model uses multiple variables as predictors and therefore would be a more accurate model compared to the Q2 model.
